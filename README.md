TrackIT is a modern, user-friendly personal finance tracker designed to simplify money management and give users deeper insight into their spending habits. Whether you're budgeting monthly expenses or just keeping an eye on day-to-day transactions, TrackIT helps you stay financially aware and in control.

Built using React JS, the app leverages powerful tools like React Hooks for managing state and side effects efficiently, enabling a clean and modular component structure. For real-time backend integration, Firebase is used for both authentication and data storage (Firestore), ensuring users' data is securely stored and instantly synced across sessions.

To streamline UI development, the app uses ANT Design, which provides a polished and responsive interface that looks great on all devices. For seamless real-time interaction with Firebase, react-firebase-hooks is integrated, allowing the app to respond to database changes instantly without manual polling or refresh.
